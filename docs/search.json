    "text": "1.1 Data Wrangling With tidyverse.\ntidyverse is a collection of packages in R that allow us to manipulate, explore and visualize data. There are a couple of packages within tidyverse (dplyr and tidyr) that we will be using to transform our data and get it ready for analysis. dplyr will allow us to do most of our data manipulation: creating new variables, renaming variables, filtering values, sorting, grouping, and summarizing, among others. tidyr will allow us to pivot data sets, unite or separate columns, and deal with missing values. Although it is always possible to complete these tasks using base R, tidyverse allows us to efficiently perform these operations using data manipulation verbs that are very intuitive to the user."

    "text": "1.2 The Avocado Data Set\nThe avocado data is weekly retail scan data for U.S retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. The data reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLUs) in the data are only for Hass avocados. Other avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this data."

Guacamole is the perfect pairing to their delicious food and one of Chipotle’s best sellers.
