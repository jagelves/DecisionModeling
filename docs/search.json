There are a couple of packages within tidyverse (dplyr and tidyr) that we will be using to transform our data and get it ready for analysis. dplyr will allow us to do most of our data manipulation: creating new variables, renaming variables, filtering values, sorting, grouping, and summarizing, among others. tidyr will allow us to pivot data sets, unite or separate columns, and deal with missing values. Although it is always possible to complete these tasks using base R, tidyverse allows us to efficiently perform these operations using data manipulation verbs that are very intuitive to the user."

Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLUs) in the data are only for Hass avocados. Other avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this data."

A Naive prediciton sets the prediction of a future period to the value of the preceding period. Your weight tomorrow is predicted to be the same as the weight observed today. Mathematically:\nWe can adjust the Naive prediction by accounting for some natural drift (an increase or decrease). As kids grow, we might expect their weight to be close to the previous measurement but slightly higher as we need to account for growth. Mathematically we would say:\nOne could also predict weight by observing your weight during a period and averaging the values. Every day the data recorded would be slightly different, but if diets, exercise, sleep, etc., remain relatively constant, the mean can be a good predictor of your future weight. Mathematically:\nLastly, we can use the weight data collected from a period and observe if there is any trend. If we find ourselves motivated to lose weight we can start recording our weight every day. Ideally, we will start seeing the effect of a diet, excercise and healthy sleep in the data. We can predict tomorrows weight by taking into account the downward trend of our weight. Formally:"

How far the fitted values are from the actual values will determine how well our model fits the data. If we square all of the distances (i.e., errors) and then average them, we calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Utlimately, how we decide to aggregate our errors will determine our measure of accuracy. For example is we follow the same procedure as the one for MSE’s but then find the square root, we have caluclated the RMSE. If we are to determine the ability of our model to predict values, we will instead compare forecasted values (derived from a training set) to a test value (or values). The training set is data that will allow us to fine-tune our model. On the other hand, the test set was not used to develop the model. By following this procedure, we ensure that our model doesn’t simply replicate the behavior in the training set but instead teases out the essential factors in the series that will allow us to forecast general tendencies effectively."

These functions are based on a specific probability distribution. For instance, the rbinom() function generates random numbers based on the binomial distribution, while the rnorm() function generates random numbers based on the normal distribution. By using these functions, we can efficiently generate random numbers that follow a specific probability distribution, which can be useful for a variety of applications.\nFor example, the binomial distribution may be useful in estimating the probability that a certain number of customers respond to a marketing campaign. However, as we will see below, we can also use the distribution to generate random customers who either responded or not responded to the campaign.\nAssume the bookstore is unsure on how many customers will buy their Monster Classic Series at list price. Their plan is to send \\(100\\) catalogs by mail to potential customers. Before they send the catalogs, they decide to get an rough idea on demand. Past data reveals that the probability a customer would buy any of the titles at the given prices is \\(0.70\\). Let’s modify our data frame by simulating demand with the rbinom() function.\n\n(MS<-data.frame(Books=c(\"Frankenstein\",\"Dracula\",\n                     \"Moby Dick\",\n                     \"War Of The Worlds\",\"Beowulf\"), \n           Price=c(9.5,5.78,6.34,5.67,2.45),\n           Demand=rbinom(5,100,0.7)))\n\n              Books Price Demand\n1      Frankenstein  9.50     68\n2           Dracula  5.78     66\n3         Moby Dick  6.34     67\n4 War Of The Worlds  5.67     72\n5           Beowulf  2.45     68\n\n\nAs you can see, the rbinom() function has yielded \\(5\\) simulated outcomes from the binomial experiment with a probability of \\(0.7\\).

For example, they will allow us to generate summary statistics like means and standard deviations of variables of interest in our simulation model. What are loops and conditionals?\nLoops and conditionals are two important control structures in the R programming language that allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions.\nA loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met.

In particular, assume that if the book is either Frankenstein or Dracula, the probability of a customer buying it is \\(0.9\\) (the probability of the other books remains at \\(0.7\\)). We can now modify our demand simulation using a loop and a conditional.\n\ndemand<-c()\n\nfor (i in MS$Books){\n  if (i==\"Frankenstein\"| i==\"Dracula\"){\n    p=0.9\n  }\n  else {p=0.7}\n  demand<-c(demand,rbinom(1,100,p))\n}\n\nprint(demand)\n\n[1] 91 93 78 70 76\n\n\nIn the code above, the inner conditional checks whether the titles are either Frankenstein or Dracula. If so, then the random binomial number is drawn with the probability \\(0.9\\), if not the it is drawn with probability \\(0.7\\). The for loop, goes through all the books in the series one by one and adds a simulated demand.
