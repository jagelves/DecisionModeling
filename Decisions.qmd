# Decisions Under Uncertainty

In this module we will learn how to create decision models. These models rely on probability and expected values. We will map the decision process using a decision tree and value each decision with an expected monetary value. Our objective is to identify the best decision given the possible choices and uncertainty.

## Shopaholic Retail Company

Imagine you are the CEO of the Shopaholic Retail Company, and you are considering whether to launch a new product line. You have conducted market research and have estimated two possible outcomes based on customer demand and competition.

* **Success Scenario:** If the new product line is well-received by customers and captures a significant market share, you anticipate an annual profit of $5 million.
* **Failure Scenario:** If the new product line fails to gain traction in the market, you estimate an annual loss of $3 million due to production costs and missed opportunities.

In this decision, you face uncertainty regarding customer preferences, market conditions, and competitive dynamics. The new product line's success or failure will determine your company's financial outcome. 

## Expected Monetary Value

To make an informed decision, you assess the probabilities of each outcome based on your market research, historical data, and/or expert opinions. For example, you might estimate a 60% chance of success and a 40% chance of failure.

Using this information, you can calculate the **expected monetary value** of the decision by multiplying the monetary value of each outcome by its respective probability and summing them up:

<div class="pull-right-50 text-center">
Expected Value = (Prob. of Success * Value of Success) + (Prob. of Failure * Value of Failure)

Expected Value = (0.6 * 5 million) + (0.4 * -3 million) 

Expected Value = 3 million + (-1.2 million) 

Expected Value = 1.8 million </div> \n


The **expected monetary value** estimates the average monetary outcome you can expect from the decision. In this example, the expected value is positive, suggesting that launching the new product line results in a profit on average. Mathematically we express the monetary expected value as the sum product of probabilities and monetary values. 

<div class="pull-right-50 text-center">
$EV=\sum p_{i}x_{i}$
</div>

where $EV$ is the expected value, $p_{i}$ is the probability of decision $i$ and $x_{i}$ is the monetary values resulting from decision $i$. Notice that if we had other decisions, we could also calculate their expected value. Hence, the expected value allows us to rank and choose decisions that yield the highest monetary value on average.

## Decision Trees

Decision trees map the entire decision process. Below you can see the decision process for the new production line.

```{mermaid theme=darkly}
%%| fig-width: 5
graph LR
    A[ ] -->|Introduce Production Line| C( ) 
    A[ ] -->|Don't Introduce| B( 0 )
    C -->|Success| D( 5 )
    C -->|Failure| E( -3 )
```

The decision tree is read from left to right. Notice that there are two main branches stemming from the first decision node (i.e., the first square to the left). You can decide to *Introduce* or *Not Introduce*. If you *Introduce*, you reach a probability node (i.e., the circle that leads to the success and failure branches) where chance determines success or failure. In the end, your choice of introducing the new produce line yields an expected monetary value of 1.8 million, whereas not introducing the line yields no payoff.

In general, to solve decision trees we use **backward induction**. Starting from the right of the decision tree and working back to the left at each probability node calculate the EMV. At each decision node, take the maximum of EMV's to identify the optimal decision.. Applying this procedure to our simple example, we would start with the probability node at the that leads to success and failure and calculate the EMV of 1.8 million. Moving back to our initial decision, we now have the choice to *Introduce* or *Not Introduce*. In this case we should *Introduce*, since the EMV is higher than *Not Introduce* (0).

## Bayes' Theorem

How does new information affect our prior expectations?

The Expected Value of Information (EVI): The increase in the expected value that the information generates (i.e. is what we gain by getting the information for free).

The Expected Value of Free and Perfect Information: The increase in the expected value that the perfect information generates (i.e. is what we gain by getting the free and accurate information).

## Readings

Readings for this chapter are mainly from @PMS. Chapter 9 provides a good introduction to decision models with a couple of solved problems included. 

@PMS Chapters 9.1 (Introduction), 9.2 (Elements of Decision Analysis), 9.3 (Single-Stage Decision Problems) and 9.5 (Multistage Decision Problems). It is recommended you follow along in R as opposed to Excel (or Precision Tree Add-In).

## Lessons Learned In This Chapter

-   Use the concept of Expected Monetary Value

-   Use Decision Trees to map the business decision process

-   Apply the backward induction method to solve single-stage and multistage decision problems
